 The <a href="https://www.8ecm.si"> 8th European Congress of Mathematics</a> organised by the Slovenia University of Primorska 
 took place in June 2021 in Portorož. Five full days of symposia and talks by leading European mathematicians.
 The congress included a symposia on the mathematical challenges in insurance, sessions on game theory, statistical and mathematical finance,
 extremal and rough probability. A plenary talk on machine deep learning and -sign of the times- a poster session on Covid-19 transmission.
