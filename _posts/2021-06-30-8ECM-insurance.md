 The <a href="https://www.8ecm.si"> 8th European Congress of Mathematics</a> organised by the Slovenia University of Primorska 
 took place in June 2021 in Portorož. Five full days of symposia and talks by leading European mathematicians.
 The congress included a symposia on the mathematical challenges in insurance, sessions on game theory, statistical and mathematical finance,
 extremal and rough probability.

Really exciting programme! Sadly, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, few could travel to <a href="https://www.portoroz.si/en/"> Portorož</a>. 
Hopefully, for the <a href="https://www.ecm2024sevilla.com/">9th European Congress in 2024 </a>, we will all meet in Seville.
