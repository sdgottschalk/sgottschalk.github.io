## Securities and Derivatives
This module is a 2-semester course on the [BSc Banking and Finance](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/banking-and-finance) at [Middlesex University](www.mdx.ac.uk). It covers the mechanics of bond, equity and derivatives markets, and on asset pricing. The assets considered are fixed income instruments, equities, options, futures and forwards, interest rate and exchange rate swaps, commodities and energy derivatives. Students who already trade in financial markets will be able to draw on their experiences to reflect on how fixed-income analytics and/or derivatives theory can inform their practice. For students who do not trade, alternative topics will include 
(i) managing, and reporting on the performance of, a portfolio of existing securities and derivatives, (ii) pricing exotic derivatives, 
such as weather, electricity, cryptocurrencies, using simulations based on existing data. Obtaining and using financial data available on Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, or Datastream is compulsory. Using Excel, and coding in Python or R is strongly encouraged.
